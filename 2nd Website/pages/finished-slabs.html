                            Evertz Technology Service USA is a leader in hot and cold slab grinding, offering advanced surface conditioning solutions for steel mills and specialty alloy producers. Our specialized grinding capabilities handle slabs at temperatures up to 1,000°F, providing efficient defect removal while maintaining optimal production flow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whether rolling or forging, semi-finished steel and alloys often require surface grinding to eliminate defects or unwanted material. Grinding is a preferred method over other surface treatment procedures due to gains in quality and utility costs. Our 45° grinding angle ensures efficient material removal while preserving slab integrity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We provide both facility-based services at our Middletown, Ohio location and on-site grinding at customer mills. This flexibility allows us to integrate seamlessly into your production process, minimizing transportation costs and handling while maximizing efficiency.

            <!-- Types of Grinding -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Types of Grinding Services</h2>
                <div class="content-text">
                    <h3>Pre-Grinding</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pre-grinding is primarily used to detect and eliminate production-related surface defects or to remove any scaling that may be present. Complete surface grinding can be performed on all sides of the product. Larger defects are detected at this stage and can be eliminated by "local grinding." With this procedure we prepare a defect-free product for further processing (e.g., cold or hot rolling).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Intermediate Grinding</h3>
                    <p>
                        Intermediate grinding is performed during the production process to address specific quality requirements between major processing steps. This ensures optimal surface condition throughout the manufacturing sequence.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Fine Grinding</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fine grinding delivers precision surface finish for products requiring superior surface quality. For billet grinding, Evertz offers both pre-grinding and fine grinding. The special unique feature of our grinding process is that billets are completely finished on the machine including deburring. Product turning is done automatically, and processing square billets up to 220 mm is possible.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Local Defects/Inspection Grinding</h3>
                    <p>
                        Targeted grinding to address specific detected defects without processing the entire surface. This cost-effective approach removes only problem areas while preserving material and processing time.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <!-- Hot vs Cold Grinding -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Hot Slab Grinding vs. Cold Grinding</h2>
                <div class="content-text">
                    <h3>Hot Grinding (Up to 1,000°F)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hot grinding is performed on slabs while they retain heat from the casting or reheating process. This method offers significant advantages including reduced material hardness for easier grinding, elimination of reheating costs, and integration directly into the production flow. Our specialized equipment and experienced operators ensure consistent results even at elevated temperatures.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cold Grinding (Ambient Temperature)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cold grinding is performed on slabs at ambient temperature, typically after cooling or storage. This method provides precise control over surface finish and is ideal for final conditioning before rolling or shipment. Cold grinding offers excellent surface quality and is preferred for certain alloys and applications where thermal considerations are critical.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Choosing the Right Method</h3>
                    <p>
                        The choice between hot and cold grinding depends on your production process, material type, quality requirements, and economic factors. Our technical team works with you to determine the optimal approach for your specific needs.

                    <p>Ground slabs undergo visual and dimensional inspection to verify that all defects have been removed and surface quality meets specifications.</p>

                    <h3>5. Material Handling</h3>
                    <p>Finished slabs are carefully handled using our overhead cranes (40 and 45 ton capacity) and prepared for the next production stage or shipment via truck or rail.</p>
